<h1>NeighbourLink</h1>

<p>Hi! This project is still a work in progress and I am confident it will be of great use to many people once finished.
<p>The intention is for the user to create an account, then the application will assign the user to their community based on the given zip-code, where they can request help from their neighbours.</p>
<p>Currently, the app is capable of login/register, adding friends, chatting and posting a task.</p>
